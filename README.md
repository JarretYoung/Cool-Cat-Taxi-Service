# Cool-Cat-Taxi-Service

This application is created as a basic taxi hailing web application. This team project was completed alone as an attempt to create a mock taxi hailing web application that would be able to accept user input of their location and desired destination and create a taxi booking for the trip. It implements an API call to MapBox api to allow for selection of location via clicking on an interactive map. Multiple pages are implemented to allow for the booking process and the viewing of bookings while using local storage to allow data to persist across pages.

**Note: Interactive map may not work anymore due to expiry of token; project was completed in 2021**
